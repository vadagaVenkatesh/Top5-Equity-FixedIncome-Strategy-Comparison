# Top5-Equity-FixedIncome-Strategy-Comparison

## Goal

This repository provides a comprehensive comparison of the top 5 recent equity and fixed income strategies. The analysis leverages free data sources, primarily Yahoo Finance, to evaluate and compare these strategies across multiple key performance metrics.

## Analysis Metrics

The comparison focuses on the following performance indicators over the past 5 years:

- **Total Return**: Overall returns generated by each strategy
- **Volatility**: Standard deviation of returns as a measure of risk
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return metric
- **Drawdown**: Maximum observed loss from peak to trough
- **Annualized Return**: Compounded annual growth rate

## Data Source

- **Yahoo Finance**: Primary data source for historical price data and financial metrics
